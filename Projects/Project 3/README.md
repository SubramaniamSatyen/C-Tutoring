# Project 3: Tic-Tac-Toe (Classes, Header Files)

For this project, we will be creating a tic-tac-toe game with a template class. On each turn, if no player has yet won, the driver code should print out the board, ask for a player, and update the board. The class should have the following functions (it can have additional functions you see fit as well)

* `bool isXTurn()` - returns true if it's X's turn, false if it's O's
* `int getWinner()` - returns a negative value if X has won, a positive value if O has won and 0 if no winner
* `void printBoard()` - a boolean variable that should be set to whether the `prices` array only contains positive values
* `bool placePiece(int pos)` - a boolean variable that should be set if the `prices` array only contains a single distinct value
* `bool isFull()` - returns true if no empty spaces on board

For this project, you may use the provided template code `Project3_Template.cpp`
