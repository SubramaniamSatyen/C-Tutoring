The projects folder of this repo contains the solutions and starter code to showcase mastery of a subset of related topics. Below is a quick summary of each project:

* Project 1: Automated Check-Out (I/O, Loops)
* Project 2: Receipt Processor (Arrays, Reference/Value)
* Project 3: Tic-Tac-Toe (Classes, Header Files)
* Project 4: 

## Additonal Resources
